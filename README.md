**Introduction:**
This project uses a deep-learning Convolutional neural network (CNN) with Long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to try and comprehend the stock market patterns and price changes.

**Prediction Method:**
In order to predict the stock market trend and interest, We use deep learning model.  
Model Input:  
The model learns for a specific stock its (normalized) price history and some of its financial indicators.  
Each data consists of predefined amount of days into the past, and the desired prediction value.  
Model Output:  
The models’ prediction value is the future normalized stock price.  
Model Layers:

**Evaluation:**
Our model uses Mean Square Error (MSE) as loss function.  
Therefore, in order to evaluate the models’ performance we convert the regression problem (Stock price prediction) to a binary problem (Will the price be higher or lower?).

Next, we use Accuracy score to present how well our model performed.  
The score is calculated by the following formula:  
(𝑇𝑁+𝑇𝑃)/(𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑁)

The accuracy is compared between binary values so we had to transform our result into binary representation.

**Conclusions:**
Learning different stocks produced varied learning curves, MSE values, and Accuracy scores.  
Some of our model predictions and evaluations are presented in the table below:
